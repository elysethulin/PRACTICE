2,Subduction,"A Definition of Addiction: ""An inability to stop despite negative consequences."" Makes sense?","This is the definition I've heard most often in the recovery community and, although it doesn't describe everybody, it makes sense to me.  

If you're not experiencing negative consequences then there isn't much to quit about, but if smoking is having a negative effect on your life, but you can't stop, then it's time to take a second look.

3,Stiffler5336,"Addiction, from a Psych Major","I've browsed /r/trees for awhile now, because I am an avid cannabis user. I've seen a lot of different things on addiction, since it seems to be the 'buzzword' and a very strong argument that people against drugs use.
I wanted to come here, while this subreddit is new and put up a good description of what addiction is.
I'd like to state before I start that I am not an expert or a specialist by any means, I am a 4th year Psychology major that specifically studies neuropsychology, so my basis is in the biology of the brain. 

For repition I'll say again that I am not a specialist or anything and this isn't taken from a textbook, this is merely my view of addiction from the point of view of a psychology student.

In my opinion there are two different types of addiction, physical and mental. Here is an example of each: 

Physical can be described as a patient in the hospital on pain medication. Pain medication infiltrates the brain and works on the chemical messengers in the brain, changing the messengers in order to get the desired effect. However, the brain is amazingly adaptive and realizes that this is happening, so when the pain killer is continually prescribed the brain eventually 'depends' on getting the certain neurotransmitter effect, and stops producing it's regular chemical messengers in the brain. So when the patient stops taking the prescribed pain killer their brain is now abnormal in that it isn't producing all the neurotransmitters it needs to be fully functional, resulting in withdrawal. 

Mental is the second method of addiction and is extremeley less dangerous. My best example of mental addiction is World of Warcraft. World of Warcraft doesn't change your brain, it doesn't directly influence any chemicals in your brain, it simply is fun. Yet many people still say WoW is addictive, and I'd have to agree that it is mentally addictive. Playing WoW grants joy, and as such when a person is doing something less fun than the amount of fun they perceive playing WoW will give them they long to play the game, becuase what they are really intereseted in is just having the best time.

If you agree with how I've defined the two types of addiction you can make your own assumption about cannabis, however I'll also explain my thoughts on cannabis and its level of addiction.

Cannabis is both mentally and physically addicting. I'd like to tackle the physical aspect first, becuase I believe a lot of pro-cannabis users will immediately disagree. However, cannabis, as in my example of physical addiction, has a direct effect on the brain and does change the neurotransmitters in the brain. However, the withdrawal symptoms of cannabis are very minor, a small headache, maybe a loss of appetite, but nothing that serious and easily faced and beaten. 
Next is the mental addiction of cannabis, I believe that this is ~90% of the actual addiction to cannabis that causes people to continually do the drug. Just like in World of Warcraft cannabis is extemely fun, and like I stated before anything that is fun and gives joy makes one want to do it again. Our inability to deny pleasure is, in my opinion, the majority reason people become 'addicted' to cannabis.

4,SaintGenevieve,Just wanted to say thanks,"I thought about putting up a self post in /r/trees a while back about thinking I was addicted to weed.  But it felt so... unusual.  I felt like a weirdo.  I just didn't think anyone would relate.  

The thing is, I can't have weed in my house without smoking it all day every day until I run out.  Luckily, being a girl and being in a new city means I don't really have a reliable ""connection"", so stopping is as simple as running out.  But that's always only temporary.

I think I'm finally coming to the realization that I just can't smoke at all.  I'm starting school this Monday.  If there was any weed in the house, I'd smoke it as soon as I got home, until I went to bed.  It's not like I get high and pass out... I just get lazy and refuse to do *anything* all day, which (predictably) seriously interferes with my life.

And another thing - I LOVE /r/trees.  There's a lot I love and appreciate about marijuana as a medicine &amp; recreational drug and about the culture surrounding it.  But I don't understand why some Ents over there are taking the creation of this subreddit as a personal attack against their choices.  Do people drinking at parties get mad at an alcoholic that's not drinking because he understands that he *must* not drink?  I just didn't expect the reaction :(

5,sleepyguy22,How much money do you / did you spend on pot? I quit because I was spending way too much. ,"If any of you have lived in Manhattan, you know that prices up here are astronomical. For three years, in 2006, 07, and 08, I was addicted and would spend almost $500/month on weed. It depleted my savings and I accumulated major credit card debt. (What you see in [this pic](http://i.imgur.com/Pbler.jpg) is about 6 months worth of weed. The smaller boxes on the right are $50 each, and the larger are $100)

At the end of 2008 I took a hard look at my finances and came to the obvious conclusion that this lifestyle was NOT sustainable. The quickest and most effective way I found to quit was simply to delete all my dealers' numbers from my phone. I went from toking up multiple times per day to quitting cold turkey overnight. For a year I didn't smoke at all, and having an additional $5-6K annually did wonders. Since then, I have paid off all my credit card debt, started a retirement 401K, and put money in savings for a rainy day. 

After a year of abstaining, I made the choice to start smoking again, but this time in a sustainable manner. I now buy a $50 every three months, and only smoke on special occasions. (Such as weekend card games and parties) I appreciate weed so much more - and since I don't smoke every day, the few times that I do I don't have to smoke as much since I don't build up that tolerance.

6,scottsutherland,Limiting dispenser device?,"This is an idea I've been pondering for a while.

I think ""addiction"" is a strong word for my situation.  I can go months without smoking when it's just a phone call away.  However, I find that whenever I do buy some, I usually end up smoking it just about every night until it's gone.  So, I am thinking about a device that would limit how often and how much pot is dispensed.  For example, a small lockbox that you would initially configure to perhaps ""open once every three days"" so that you can open it, take out a bit for a small bowl, and then close it, and then it will remained locked for the next 72 hours, at which time it would unlock until you wanted to smoke again.

I think a device like this would be *great*.  Anybody have any pointers on if something like this already exists, or advice on the easiest way to go about creating something like this?  Thanks.",1294541512,eyrq7,7,7,leaves,1,1,2011,"this is an idea i've been pondering for a while.

7,Tasulian,My experience with addiction . . .,"I personally have seen many examples of addiction in my lifetime. Most of the current ones are at my job. I work in a casino. I see gambling addicts on a daily basis. The more I think about my experiences at work, the more I feel I need to ask a question (More on that later). 

I don't think I need to go into detailed specifics, but I have seen players who have missed their kids' birthdays because they were on a gambling binge. I have seen the promise of sexual favors for enough money to play one more hand of blackjack. But that's not the fucked up part.

The fucked up part is that I don't have any way to help. This isn't because I don't want to help. It's because *they don't want to be helped*. If I were to make the suggestion to a player that they have a gambling problem, I would get a lot of reactions, from laughter to anger. However, not one of them would change their behavior, unless they wanted to do so. They have to see it for themselves, and a lot of people can't. 

I know a card dealer that cried one day because one of her favorite players was putting himself on the self-exclusion list (The list that you, and only you, can put yourself on in my state when you feel you can't control your gambling problem. Once on the list, you aren't allowed into any casino in the state). 

The ambiguity of it all is that she cried because she was losing a friend. She saw this man every day. She knew him as close as she knew a personal friend. She knew about his family, his kids, his job. She also knew that once he signed that list, she would never see him again. She was losing her friend, and she was happy for him. She knew it would be for the best.

Well, I guess I did go into some specific examples, but it leads me to my question. I feel the most important step in recovering from addiction is admitting to yourself that you have one. A lot of people that come may wonder if they have a problem. My question is for those who have personally dealt with the issue. How do you identify if you have a problem?

9,MrHorticulture,Urgh...,"That's what I tend to feel all the time :[


Keeping it short, I've smoked trees for 5 years and spent...just so much money on it. Two years ago I had £4500, now I have -600. I'm too lazy to get a job, so I'm smoking myself hard into my overdraft, and this can't go on. But - and I'm sure everyone gets this - I *don't want to stop smoking.* I hate this feeling. But I hate not smoking trees. And I'm one of those ""if I've got, I'll smoke it"" kind of people that finds it hard to space it out. I don't even know if I'm asking anything, or just venting. If there is a question in here, then I suppose it is: how does one cut slowly down? Is there a 'best' method for this? Some kind of long-term schedule (or personal experience) would be great, I can follow that sort of thing for exercise etc. The idea of just stopping for a year scares me...I can just sense being a year of anger, frustration, a and lack of creativity. I love me my music, so I'd hate to lose that :[

*******************

Absurdly overlong UPDATE, for anyone interested:

For a start, I should point out that I did not spend *all* that money on weed, but still a significant proportion of it.

I decided that to get what I want from this, I'd need to do it in a manageable way. Now, as I mentioned above, I tend to smoke at my own pace and find it hard not to do so. Here's what I've done:

I buy an 8th at the beginning of the week. I do *not* buy again until a week later. That might still seem a lot to some, but it's a fair amount less than usual, as left to my own devices I can smoke anything from a 30s (3 16ths, I guess) to a half ounce per week. How do I make this reduction work? No smoking until after dinner. Just do everything that needs to be done, before 6-8pm, as a loose rule. I'm not saying I study all day (because I don't and wouldn't want to) and I'm still not the most productive person, but it's something. I also start every day, before breakfast, with a cigarette and a strong coffee. The fag (UK, leave me alone!) means that I have no particular desire to smoke again straight away, and the coffee is nothing but a replacement drug, it works. I am a massive lightweight to stimulants, so try to enjoy the 'buzz' that caffeine gives me.

Midweek, inevitably, I find that I've had a little more out of that baggie than I should have, and start worrying about whether it's going to last me over the weekend. This is where I have to get a little obsessive about it, but that's fine, I think. I'll separate what I've got into daily amounts, as dcss suggested below, though I didn't see their comment til today. And here's where it gets anal: so I've got my daily amount. After dinner, I then separate *that* and see how many spliffs I can get out of it. These inevitably end up being fairly weak ones (""yeah, I can get 3 out of that..."") and plan out when I'll have them. One at 8, one at 10, one at 12, for example. If I've only got 2, then I'll have them at 9 and 11.

What's interesting is that after a couple of weeks of this, I found that my tolerance was noticeably dropping, and those 2 or 3 *weak* end-of-week smokes a night get me more stoned than I would have been, had I been smoking all day. You ever get to that point where having a smoke doesn't really seem to do a whole lot? Sometimes I would find myself thinking ""wait, did I just have a spliff? I'm honestly not sure."" Not any more.

And as for the creativity, nothing to worry about. In fact, that's better too. My process is this: I've had my dinner, but I know I can't start smoking yet cos I won't be able to last all night. So I'll start some new track (I use Reason, for those curious ;P) and it'll sound alright, nothing too special. Just some chords or something, an interesting noise, some basic drums. Then, when it's time, I'll have me smoke. I'll come back and WOW, it now sounds fucking awesome, or has the potential to. Because when I actually start something sober, its inevitably clearer and more...logical. And *then* I can let the ganja do its work, and draw out all those little emotional nuances. Repeating this 'approach sober, approach lean, approach sober etc' results in more balanced, thought-out tracks over time, and it's very satisfying, actually. It reminds me of the Family Guy episode where Peter and Lois get into trees, and they think their song is beautiful when in fact it's an incoherent mess. You *want* that sense of unrealistic beauty, but it's made all the better when you actually made half of it with a clear and rational mind. It's all relative.

Being stoned gets a whole lot better when you have something to compare it to. If stoned is the norm, then it's just that: standard. Typical. If you want to make it interesting again, just try what I'm doing, and you might appreciate it more. I'm not saying I'm going to cut down any more, because I'm quite happy where I've got to, actually. And fuck it, it's only been a month or so since I stuck to the 8th-a-week thing. I'd be happy to answer any questions, though this update was more of a word of encouragement to anyone who's fearful of the prospect of not being baked 24/7.

Trust me, being a bit more clear-headed, and having higher energy levels is not so bad ;] I should also point out that I started exercising for the first time in my life, and eating healthier (and eating more, I'm a twig), a week or so before christmas. I can actually recommend the combination of less smoke, more health...from the world's laziest arsehole, believe it or not! :]

**TL;DR**  Having a set weekly amount that you *do not go over*, to the obsessive point of having 7 daily stashes organised into spliffworths (or bowlworths), so you know *exactly* how much you're going to smoke and when...this is a pretty tolerable, easy way to cut down.",1294585982,eyzb0,10,10,leaves,1,1,2011,"that's what i tend to feel all the time :[

what's interesting is that after a couple of weeks of this, i found that my tolerance was noticeably dropping, and those 2 or 3 *weak* end-of-week smokes a night get me more stoned than i would have been, had i been smoking all day. you ever get to that point where having a smoke doesn't really seem to do a whole lot? sometimes i would find myself thinking ""wait, did i just have a spliff? i'm honestly not sure."" not any more.

and as for the creativity, nothing to worry about. in fact, that's better too. my process is this: i've had my dinner, but i know i can't start smoking yet cos i won't be able to last all night. so i'll start some new track (i use reason, for those curious ;p) and it'll sound alright, nothing too special. just some chords or something, an interesting noise, some basic drums. then, when it's time, i'll have me smoke. i'll come back and wow, it now sounds fucking awesome, or has the potential to. because when i actually start something sober, its inevitably clearer and more...logical. and *then* i can let the ganja do its work, and draw out all those little emotional nuances. repeating this 'approach sober, approach lean, approach sober etc' results in more balanced, thought-out tracks over time, and it's very satisfying, actually. it reminds me of the family guy episode where peter and lois get into trees, and they think their song is beautiful when in fact it's an incoherent mess. you *want* that sense of unrealistic beauty, but it's made all the better when you actually made half of it with a clear and rational mind. it's all relative.

being stoned gets a whole lot better when you have something to compare it to. if stoned is the norm, then it's just that: standard. typical. if you want to make it interesting again, just try what i'm doing, and you might appreciate it more. i'm not saying i'm going to cut down any more, because i'm quite happy where i've got to, actually. and fuck it, it's only been a month or so since i stuck to the 8th-a-week thing. i'd be happy to answer any questions, though this update was more of a word of encouragement to anyone who's fearful of the prospect of not being baked 24/7.

trust me, being a bit more clear-headed, and having higher energy levels is not so bad ;] i should also point out that i started exercising for the first time in my life, and eating healthier (and eating more, i'm a twig), a week or so before christmas. i can actually recommend the combination of less smoke, more health...from the world's laziest arsehole, believe it or not! :]

**tl;dr**  having a set weekly amount that you *do not go over*, to the obsessive point of having 7 daily stashes organised into spliffworths (or bowlworths), so you know *exactly* how much you're going to smoke and when...this is a pretty tolerable, easy way to cut down.",FLASE
10,leavesaccount,My Story On Quitting (Long),"I wanted to share my story here, tell you a little about myself (fake account) and how I quit smoking trees.  To do that, though, I should probably start with how I began smoking trees.

To make a long story short, I hang out with a bunch of losers in highschool.  Well, not really losers, just the generally misunderstood, highly intelligent, introverted, but also very geeky people in highschool.  Middle class suburban kids, some of whom were more ""indie.""  

We weren't as a collective, uncool, we just were the ""floaters;"" you know, the people who are quasi-friends with everyone people. Also known as ""don't give a fuck.""  Naturally, smoking weed was the norm.

It took a great amount of time/independent research of my own to conclude that I wanted to smoke weed for the first time.  And smoke I did.  For the many months and years that followed, I toked up daily.

Nothing seemed to happen.  I kept my friends, my job, and my own identity--at least that is how it appeared on the outside.  After many years of doing this, and smoking later in college, I was falling behind in school and so too were my friends.  I became lazy, unmotivated, and desired nothing but what would make me immediately happy, even if there were significant long-term (but largely unnoticeable in the short-term) costs.

Marijuana made me patient for trivial matters, but also those of importance.  As long as I had marijuana, most everything else could be delayed. 

**Fast Forward**

Today, I'm the only one in still in college of the eight of my friends who went to school with me.  I work forty hours a week, and have maintained a 4.0 GPA since I quit smoking.  I have been an absolute success, and will not at all hide my own ego in saying so.  **It has been, for me, a 180-degree reversal.**

My friends however have all fell to low-paying, minimum-wage food preparation jobs in fast food and now (mostly) all live together in a single house, where they all smoke daily.  They drink, as well, though that's a pretty new development.  

Between four people, I believe, there are at least 3 DUIs and numerous possession/paraphernalia charges, and not a *glimmer of hope for any one of them*.  Opportunities abandoned all-around, their impulsivity (a trait none had before smoking) is a deterrent to any real improvement.

**There is one very distinct difference between my friends and I.**  I quit without my friends, my friends continue smoking with my friends.  They are no longer the people they once were, slowly losing their minds, and frankly, I am surprised that one is even still capable of breathing.  

I quit when, after a period of many years, I had enough.  I stopped answering my friends phone calls and I spent many nights by myself.  Pleasurable? No, but it set the stage for a ""new me.""

I ignored those who I considered my best of buds (no pun intended), and today I would consider them nothing more than acquaintances.  **At first it was difficult to separate myself from my friends, but in retrospect, it was a far easier path than to lose all potential.**

In the one year that has followed, they have asked many times what happened to the friendship.  I must confess, albeit only to myself, that I cannot afford such friends.

**Final Thoughts**

I hate to say it, but there is absolutely no way to beat the odds.  You are a product of those with whom you acquaint, and so too is your decision-making process.  To believe any differently is pure naivety.

And I should comment, also, that the biggest danger of marijuana is not its inherent danger.  No, marijuana will not kill you.  It does, however, have a very large impact on your state of mind, your energy levels, and any desire to improve yourself.  **The biggest danger, I believe, is its perceived lack of danger.**

The biggest risk is that you lose dreams,  or ambitions because you kill the time you would normally dedicate to them.

This isn't, however, an actual loss and is easily ignored when you're addicted/engaged in repetition/whatever.  You've only lost what you could have been.  You cannot see this or touch it.  Nor can you know that you have lost it, nor what may have come as a result of taking that first step.

You see, when I quit smoking, I began to see the million-mile journey that would follow the first step, and earned back a very driven state of mind that I  had not seen since my teens.  When I smoked, I saw only the barriers to the first step, ignoring the benefits of the path that followed.

Do not, under any circumstances, think shutting your friends off is the wrong thing to do.  Your friends are your environment.  A toxic environment is a toxic you.  A healthy environment is a healthy you.

If you really want to quit smoking weed, you will have to quit your friends.  That is, unfortunately, the very first step.  However, it does begin the million mile journey that lies ahead.

I was the dude who made fun of the idea of cannabis addiction, because I didn't think it was a real thing.  I changed, though, and you can help more people like me change too.

It happened about 10 or 11 years ago, at a party in high school.  I had rolled up a big ol' blunt, and was asking around to make sure I didn't leave anyone out.  Someone said something like ""Hey, you should ask Chad, I think he smokes.""  So I did, and he said no thanks, he was trying to quit.  I incredulously asked him why, and he said his grades had dropped.  Instead of just leaving it at that, I got into a debate with him about whether cannabis could be addictive, and basically tried to cajole him into smoking with us (""well, do you have an exam tomorrow? then what difference does it make?"").

He called me out on my bullshit.  I don't recall the exact words, but the gist of it was, ""Look, you don't know what my personal experience is, and right now you're being an asshole.  Would you be hassling someone who was trying to lose weight to eat cheesecake?""

Of course, he was dead right.  The fact that he was right hit me like a ton of bricks, and I couldn't believe how I had been acting.  But for some reason, it took a person like him calling me out on my shit bring me to that realization.

16,khaledthegypsy,Trying to stop smoking weed too but I have a plan. Also this is going to be a long story.,"I have been smoking for 5 years now, 1/4 of my life. And for the past 2 years i've smoked almost every single day. Actually, my loyalty to weed was so powerful that i would smoke on average 3 blunts a day and even when travelling with my family i would find ways to pick up weed. In fact one time while in Florida on vacation i walked through the streets with my brother trying to pick up from random people...and succeeded, got half an eighth for 25 (not bad for random guy methinks). Anyways, like most other people who smoke weed for an extended period of time i tried to stop on numerous occasions and failed within 2 days. This is the start of my 4th day of sobriety. The reason I believe i will succeed this time is as follows...
I gave all my money to my mother, also my debit card in exchange for a credit card that i cannot withdraw money from. I then acknowledged the fact that there was no way in hell i would be able to quit smoking overnight so what i am currently doing is weaning myself off with this Middle eastern type of pipe called medwakh used for smoking tobacco( you take 3 hits and hold 'em all in and boom, like busting a nut without busting a nut). When i can really no longer take it I buy a swisher. Since this began, the first day i could not sleep until almost 4 am, and that was only because i smoked my first swisher since the trial. The next day i began to feel the effects of sobriety hitting me in full effect, i knew i couldnt sleep but i was also becoming irritable. I began to smoke the medwakh incessantly for that day and i should also note that i am not cleaning this pipe whatsoever. That is because the dirtier it gets, the more disgusting it tastes, and everytime i hit it i am dissuaded from smoking anything. Yesterday i bought the second swisher and smoked only half of it as oppose to the whole thing the first day. I still have about 1/5th of the swisher left. I only hit the medwakh 5 times today which in my opinion is amazing progress since back when i was smoking regularly it would not be odd to hit it 5 times in a single kick it. I know that this is not the end but just the beginning of my journey but I am not alone. My friend is doing this with me as he was just as big of a pothead but interestingly enough we have not been hanging out as much since. This i believe is for the best at least for a few weeks. I should note also that we are both dealing with it in completely different ways, I have immersed myself in doing things, regardless of what they are; going to the movies, working, just trying to keep busy without blazing while he comes back from work everyday and just passes out. His idea is that if he sleeps instead of doing anything, he will not be smoking weed. So far both of us have completed day 3 and welcome Day 4.

18,phanner,Stopped Smoking For Last 2 Weeks But Unsure About It,"I've been smoking weed daily with maybe 5 breaks of &lt; 10 days for the last 14 years.  I did well at a pretty good college getting high at night after studying and on the weekends.  I've spent quite a lot of time following Phish around the country and most of my friends are from that scene.  For those of you that don't know, there is quite a bit of drug use in that scene and I have and still do partake in psychedelics.  I only party like that at shows though.  My only consistent daily drug use is cannabis.

In spite of smoking all that weed, I managed to get an M.S. and a Ph.D in a pure science and am currently employed at a prestigious University doing research.  This fucks with my head a little bit, because my life is clearly not being ruined by this drug.  I've been wondering if I should quit smoking, but when I read around here it seems that people are going through a lot more negative consequences than I am.  My wife and I spend maybe $150/month on weed, but we both have pretty good jobs so it's not really negatively affecting us financially.  I've become disenchanted with my job in the last year and sometimes I think I would either be better at it or be more into it if I didn't puff, but on the other hand maybe I would want to quit anyway.  Not liking my job has made feel trapped and stuck and I think I've been using weed to not have to feel that feeling so much.

So, my wife and I stopped smoking 12 days ago to see if it would make our marriage better/us happier/me more productive/etc.  I didn't really feel any withdrawal type symptoms other than thinking about using.  I slept fine and I wasn't cranky or irritated.  I do feel like my head is a little bit clearer, but that might be because I've been hitting the gym pretty hard and that's how I usually feel when I work out a lot.

Now it's the 2nd weekend since we stopped and I'm wondering if I should get high tonight.  I don't know if this is reasonable or just the ""disease"" taking over.  Hell, I'm not even sure I qualify as an addict since the whole negative consequences thing is not crystal clear for me.  In some weird way, one of the main things that's keeping me from smoking right now is that I don't want to have to tell my shrink that I got high, even though he's very non-judgemental.

Hello leaves. I'm having some serious problems right now and was wondering if somebody had any advice.

I was a pretty serious smoker for about 4 years. I'm talking about regular everyday smoking for a long period. Lately I've decided I need to stop and it's been 10 days so far.

Anyone that tells you that cannabis withdrawal syndrome is not real is lying. The second day was the worst. My girlfriend came over to watch a movie and I felt like I was Renton in Trainspotting. We were in bed and I was freezing. After i covered mysef up i was burning and sweating all over my body, and I usually really don't sweat much, ever. I had to go take a shower a couple of times. I had heatwaves coming over me for a couple of hours and I basically felt like somebody beat me up, imagine being really hungover. I lost all appetite, I had a normal meal twice in the last 10 days, most days I go with eating a banana or an apple, I just can't bring myself to put food in my mouth.

But that's not the worst part. I've broken down 6-7 times lately, crying, and I don't think I've ever felt this depressed before. I've always had trouble with my mood, had my share of depressive episodes over the years, but I've always managed to control them. Trees helped.

I'm having suicidal thoughts amongst others. The main problem is I'm in a relationship and I'm afraid this is going to hurt it really bad.

So my fellow ents, share your story and help me out. I'm probably going to see a psychiatrist this week because I don't think I'll be able to do this on my own.

158,[deleted],Severely depressed after smoking 8 years,"The first time I toked up was on 4/20 of 2003.  I was 17.  I've smoked on a very regular basis since then.  I've been through many periods of daily usage.  Sometime in 2008 was when I started smoking during the daytime.  Not long after, I began getting stoned during work and other important events.  I currently smoke multiple times per day.

I love weed.  I love the taste of it, I love the smell of it, I love the way sticky buds feel as you break them up with your fingertips.  I love the way the first hit of the day fills up your head with smoke.  I love the way my favorite songs sound when I'm high.  I love the culture and the friendships I've built around weed.

But, I have mild/moderate depression and anxiety, and weed makes it much, much worse.  Weed has worsened my depression so much at times that I've felt suicidal and tried harder drugs.  When I smoke daily, the depression I feel is overwhelming.  It takes away any sense of joy, save for those first couple tokes of the day.

I also lose all motivation, so I don't look for better work or exercise or eat right.  I just eat junk food and feel fat and gross.  Weed exacerbates other problems that in turn exacerbate the depression.

I'm not able to moderate my usage.  I can't just get high on the weekends, or once in awhile after work.  If I'm getting high at all, it has to be all the fucking time.

I have stopped for brief periods.  I stopped for two months after my fiancé left me over all my depressive issues.  I stopped again for three weeks when I had to pass a drug test to get a job.  During the periods I've stopped, my depression has gotten better.  It's showed me that weed is a major part of the problem.

211,[deleted],One week willingly pot-free after an eight-year psychological addiction. ,"Hey all. I mostly wanted to make this post to help others in a similar situation to me, and also because it feels damn good talking about it.

For eight years, ever since I was 16, I have had a hopeless psychological addiction to weed. When I say ""psychological addiction,"" I mean it. I originally started smoking to sooth the thoughts of suicidal ideation and severe depression I was going through. In my mind, it was less harmful long-term than, say, self-mutilation or actually attempting suicide. Not to do the whole song-and-dance, but needless to say, my situation was horrific, as an isolated, 16 year-old queer girl with no friends and two abusive parents. 

Quitting before (usually due to lack of money/dealer being out, not out of actual desire to quit) has usually been met with the following reactions: emotional breakdowns, crying fits, severe sleep disturbances, horrific body pain (which I now know is caused by Fibromyalgia), and pretty much every indication of a psychological addiction you can think of, including drug-seeking.

Now, one week in, the dreams, the breakdowns, and the body pain are all there, but... I feel calmer, for some reason. Maybe it's because this is a choice this time, and not out of me simply running out with no way of getting more. 

**What's worked for me is** putting all of my glassware, properly cleaned and stored away, into a box in the closet. Second order of business was getting rid of ALL weed, both the vaped stuff I had saved for cannabutter, and all of the fresh stuff I had. I even got rid of the keif. I stored and cleaned the vapourizer as well. Next order of business was a YMCA membership, so I could start exercising - not because I'm terribly out of shape, but just to have something to look forward to each day. Exercise also has the added benefit of increasing energy and lowering depression. That's just to start with. The local YMCA also offers Meditation, so I'll be trying that as well, as a way of achieving 'calm' without being stoned out of my mind. 

**If you feel the need to smoke again** just remember that there is ALWAYS weed available SOMEWHERE. That might seem a bit counter-intuitive, but it makes sense. For me, at least, the knowledge that the tool I've used to manage my depression is out there, somewhere, ready to be found is comforting to me. Don't give in - just breathe, and remember, that if you're ever that fucked up again, you could probably find some weed somewhere really easily. Just let it pass through you. You don't actually need it. It'll make you feel dull and tired, just like every other time. 

**tl;dr:** If you have a psychological addiction to weed like me, get rid of the weed you have, and start doing something with yourself, even if it feels shitty to start with - exercise is a good idea, and there is almost always a local sliding-scale YMCA in most urban areas. Life doesn't have to be horrific depression in between bong hits.

276,throwaway38291,I don't feel like I want to quit. I just don't want to feel like this anymore.,"Lemme give you the Clif Notes:

Mom and Dad met in AA meetings, though they both worked the GA/NA trifecta before all was said and done. Mom hooked up with a sadistic fuck of a human being, and from ages 6-10 I lived in what Family Services called ""torturous conditions"". Got placed with Dad, who stayed sober but still didn't know how to raise a kid. Lasted about three years there before he knocked my skull in and I ran away. Shuttled between homeless shelters and foster programs, ended up getting placed BACK with my Dad because no one really wanted to deal with me for long. (As you can imagine, I'd internalized a pretty strong dislike for authority and penchant for violence.)

Squeaked out of my teen years alive, despite persistent suicidal feelings. Decided all would be better once I managed to transition to living as a woman. (Oh, I'm transgendered. Did I mention that? Prolly should.) Realized that the money needed for transition and the likelihood of finding a job as a 6'+ woman with a five o'clock shadow didn't mesh, so spent about five years meandering from job to job and home to homelessness. In the process, fell off a roof and royally fucked my back, which was compounded by scoliosis the school docs had never caught and a cyst the size of a fist behind my abdominal wall that I had removed once, and grew back.

My best friend, who quite possibly had a life even more fucked up than my own, started smoking trees... all of a sudden, it was like he had come back alive. He didn't cry all the time, he actually wanted to do things, he LAUGHED again. I tried it, found the first relief I'd had since my back pain started. (With my family history, I always opted for ""deal with it"" rather than risk opioid dependency.)

I started working out again, got into the best shape of my life, and came to the realization that living as a freak happy in my own body probably beat hating the coward I saw in the mirror and wanting to kill myself, so I started transitioning anyway.

In the meantime, my best friend headed downhill - he'd sought psychiatric help and they told him that trees were the reason he was depressed, and he needed to stop smoking them and start taking their drugs. He went through a few hospital stays, and cycled through something like 18 medications over the course of three years. He decided to get a fresh start in a new state, and I went with him.

My hormones were off the charts (remember when puberty hit full swing? Yeah, something like that) and he was on and off so many meds that his side effects were nearly as bad as his symptoms. We argued, he kicked me out, I let him and cut ties. I built a new life from nothing. Again. Lost my car, found a partner, talked my way into a retail job and consistently outperformed anyone's expectations. All while smoking.

Got suicidally depressed earlier this year when I realized there probably wasn't going to be a time when my life became a ""normal"" woman's, and I'd probably always wonder if the people laughing when I went out were laughing at me. Spent some time in the hospital, quit smoking, started the doc's drugs. Ended up smoking after a month anyway, and back to business as usual.

Two weeks ago, my best friend (who had moved back home) drove to my state, bought a gun, and blew his head off in a park. Went home to find out he'd told everyone how ashamed he was of how things ended with us, and how he wished we could reconnect. I was one of his last friends that he pushed away, and to avoid portraying myself as a saint I said my own share of fucking hurtful things when I was feeling hurt myself. Since it happened, I alternate between autopilot, sleeping too much, smoking myself out of the reality of the situation, and uncontrollable sobbing/screaming. My whole life has been chaos, and the 15 years I knew him was longer than I'd had contact with anyone in my life including my own parents. We spent most of that 15 years seeing each other every day.

So now I haven't smoked for a week, because I'm out and I don't have the money for more anyway. I also don't have the money to see my doctor about my med levels, or my shrink about how fucked up I feel. I work 40 hours a week in a retail hell that makes me want to scream, and pay 20% of everything I make into an insurance policy that, with my shitty retail wage, I still can't afford to use. My back is agony, my cyst randomly abscesses and bleeds, and I'm still a 6'+ woman who questions every look people give me. I don't want to overstate my case for the Oppression Olympics, but the job market doesn't get any easier when you're an unprotected minority. I still want to kill myself.

I am so incredibly scared of following the same path he did, pushing people away and riding the pharmaceutical merry-go-round til I look for the fastest way out. I also don't like feeling like I'm carrying on the proud family tradition of addiction - but the ""haze"" is the only time I feel beautiful, the only time I feel worthwhile, the only time I stop thinking about why the fuck I should bother long enough to bother and do something.

so now i haven't smoked for a week, because i'm out and i don't have the money for more anyway. i also don't have the money to see my doctor about my med levels, or my shrink about how fucked up i feel. i work 40 hours a week in a retail hell that makes me want to scream, and pay 20% of everything i make into an insurance policy that, with my shitty retail wage, i still can't afford to use. my back is agony, my cyst randomly abscesses and bleeds, and i'm still a 6'+ woman who questions every look people give me. i don't want to overstate my case for the oppression olympics, but the job market doesn't get any easier when you're an unprotected minority. i still want to kill myself.

i am so incredibly scared of following the same path he did, pushing people away and riding the pharmaceutical merry-go-round til i look for the fastest way out. i also don't like feeling like i'm carrying on the proud family tradition of addiction - but the ""haze"" is the only time i feel beautiful, the only time i feel worthwhile, the only time i stop thinking about why the fuck i should bother long enough to bother and do something. what the fuck do i do?",TRUE
306,[deleted],I abuse marijuana to escape from reality. [x-post from /r/offmychest],"I started smoking casually (once a month or less) when junior year in high school started, now I'm a senior and have smoked nearly every day since the summer. I've met more people and become less socially awkward, but I can't say that I have any real friends. I'm too much of a pussy to make a move on any girl, and the few girls who show interest in me are extremely undesirable. I don't know how much longer I can go on living in the vicious cycle that is escaping every night and suffering during the day.

Hey everybody,

So I've been THC free for 6 days now (woot!). I'm not gunna lie, things are pretty rough. All of the emotions which I had been suppressing by smoking are starting to present themselves, and it is a bummer. I had borderline suicidal thoughts today, which almost scared me back to smoking. It doesnt help that I screwed myself over by not going to class for a month during my recent binge, which is starting to catch up with me.

I don't feel any different from when I had been smoking, I still have the same lack of motivation to do anything that requires effort. The only thing that is different is that I'm now depressed and not sleeping.

One quote from The Dark Knight is keeping me going right now, ""The night is blackest just before the dawn"" or whatever it is. I know that I must deal with these emotions before I can begin to repair myself, but frankly, I don't know if I can do it.

Can anybody who has gone through something similar give me some words of encouragement or something? I don't know if I can do this anymore.",1320987662,m8d5a,12,14,leaves,6,11,2011,"[original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/lymlm/im_done_with_this_shit/)

I don't want to say I'm unhappy, because I'm not. Every day I'll make sure to include a fun activity, whether it be walking, going on bike rides,  smoking, or playing guitar. But I still feel genuinely out of place. Frankly, I feel like I haven't aged at all since August. It's as if everyday is a dream, and that one day I'll wake up and I'll get to start school over. Time passes way to quickly. It's the sort of thing where you'll try to remember what you did yesterday and you won't remember. I'm set on transferring schools at the end of the year but it doesn't really give me any relief. I've had a few awful experiences before and I convinced that it's become a problem again. However I'll put it this way: I've never been more depressed, and life has never been more beautiful. I spend more time now than ever simply thinking about how improbable my life is, going out into the woods and absorbing the amazing world in which we live in. Which brings me to my final point:

Last night I met up with 5 friends from my high school for dinner and coffee. I had smoked about 3 hours earlier and although the depth of my high was in the walk into town to meet them I was still a bit detached from them, and I kept quiet for most of our meet-up, which lasted for a few hours, except for an occasional comment which they would find humorous. Hearing about all of their crazy college adventures, meeting tons of cool people and going to parties (I can't drink this year because of tuberculosis medication), made me genuinely envious but I didn't really show it. In fact I didn't really show them anything. However I could see how off they thought I was. Even we were hanging out in my dorm room I didn't participate that much in the conversation. At about 9 they left and I must have cried for about half an hour, something I don't do very often, before falling asleep for almost 12 hours.

I honestly have no idea what I think about marijuana. On the one hand, I feel that if it didn't help me find life beautiful, I probably would have dropped out of school or become suicidal. However, I also feel it only perpetuates my social isolation. I've tried to make it into a social activity but I go to an Ivy league school where very few people smoke and many are super judgmental about smoking and will get mad if you stink up the hallways.

I smoked every day atleast twice to five times a day.  It may not be alot to you, but it was how I dealt with everything in my life.  If I didn't have weed (which you know, shouldn't ever have happened) I drank.  

I needed to quit and boyfriend was the best excuse.  Except I got a sponsor faster than he did.  Cut to a week ago and I'm being a ragin bitch.  Boyfriend breaks up with me. 2 days later, I find out I have herpes.  I move houses.  Old landlord is keeping 900 of MY money.  And here I am sitting at my job not doing a fucking thing.

My moms cancer is getting worse.  My sister is going into labor either today or tomorrow and I can't be there because I might be a raging fucking bitch.

FUCK I CANT TAKE THIS SHIT ANY MORE.  I had so many suicidal thoughts last night that I just want to grab a gun.  

I can't use anymore.  That much is obvious.  Everyone would be so disappointed if I used again.  But I'm finding it hard to appreciate sobriety.  My sponsor had me make a list of 10 things I am grateful for in sobriety.  There are alot of important things on that list!

But none of it seems to matter right now.  ALL I WANT IS A GODDAMN SPILFF.  But I won't let myself.  Thus my brain has decided that suicide is the way to go.  

Yes I've heard it gets better.  I just have to wait.  But why do I have to cry every day?  Why do I have to alienate the people I care about in the process of sobriety?

Ex-boyfriend is not on the wagon anymore.  Like it matters. Like he would even touch me again after finding out about fun uncurable diseases. 

I know I have so much to live for.  I'm pretty, and I'm smart and I have a loving family.  I just can't seem to care.  I just want to put a gun to my head and pull the fucking trigger.  I don't want to call my sponsor.  I've been going to AA meetings nonstop and calling her every day.  It was cleansing for awhile.  And now my disease is raging at me again and again and again.

None of my stuff is unpacked in my new place.  Everything is a fucking mess in this black shithole.  I don't want to wake up tomorrow.  

Yeah I'm short sighted.  They say it gets better.  The wreckage of our past comes hurling back at us.  I don't fucking care.  I just want my man back.

469,[deleted],Is considering whether you need to stop proof that you should?,"I used cannabis to help recover from a stroke and continued to use it to treat headaches, period pain, lack of appetite, etc. Usage got too intense, so I quit for a year and a half without much of a problem. My sobriety was reinforced by a boyfriend who was staunchly anti-pot. Have since broken up with him and after a little while I had gone back to pot and used regularly for the last two or three years.

But around the end of 2011 it was time to take a break and even as I get sober and feel fine sober, I am drawn back to using it; I even recently invested in an MFLB and feel like I am wasting my own money not using it.

It seems like a good idea to quit pot, at least for awhile, but at the same time the positive benefits of it taunt me: it helps me sleep, it also helps me cope with sleep-deprivation better than coffee, it creatively stimulates me and improves my self-confidence, etcetera etcetera.

This may seem obvious, but I could just use a little reassurance: is the very fact that I feel torn about going back to even casual usage proof that I should remain sober? It feels like yes, it is, but I would just like to hear someone else say it, or at least help me refine my thinking.

I could really use the money from reselling my MFLB, too, but I feel like I'll regret reselling it even more than I regret buying it, if that makes sense.

505,[deleted],Serious depression during withdrawl,"I've heard of this subreddit before from r/trees and never gave it much thought until today. Today I decided that I'm going to quit using cannabis and hopefully keep all psychoactive drug use to a minimum. I've been using cannabis almost everyday (mainly smoking but also vaping some and occassionally making edibles) for about the past 15 months. I initially found it to be a godsend, as I was drinking heavily from around the time I graduated high school in spring 2008 until I started smoking trees in fall of 2010. I still drink some, but it's nothing compared to what it was before I started using cannabis. The problem is that I've been using both of these substances (as well as DXM for a little while last year) to cover up pain. When I was drinking heavily, I would always do it alone at night, and that's usually how I've used cannabis since I stopped drinking so much. A lot of it is because of depression, boredom and loneliness. I feel like I don't have a good social support system that allows me to be happy (or simply not suicidal) without dulling my pain with psychoactive chemicals. I will admit a lot of it is lack of motivation. I don't feel like it's cannabis or alcohol that causes me to be unmotivated, but lack of purpose in life. I feel like my substance use is inseparably related to lack of purpose and any strong motivating factors in my life. I know that I really want to stop using chemicals as my main emotional support and start becoming more emotionally attached to the people around me and expereince life more fully. As of typing this, I haven't used cannabis (or any other drug besides tobacco) in 18 hours, and I've been crying a lot in the past several hours and have had some thoughts of suicide. The thoughts of suicide are normal for me, as during middle school, high school, and any time where I was sober for more than a day or two I've tended to get them.

637,selfmedicENTing,"Self medicating, what do? (Throwaway Rant.)","I’ve been self medicating for depression for over a decade.

750,[deleted],Today is Day 15,"Yesterday, Day 14, was horrible for me. I am not sure what happened exactly... something about watching the movie Monsters absolutely crushed my soul into smithereens (if you haven't seen it, watch it, it is not an action Monster movie but more like a quiet independent film about two normal people thrust into extraordinary circumstances, and the ugliness of humanity and how everything may just be completely hopeless... yeah I'm sure you want to watch it now... if you do, just pay attention to the ending, and maybe rewind all the way back to the beginning so you can truly understand the movie... only once I did this did the real implications of the movie set in and the true horror of it all astounded me).

After that I became obsessed with how much I hate my parents. How, when I was 15 and after being upset that they wouldn't let me go see a movie with some internet friends, I locked myself in my room for a day and didn't want to see them. Apparently this enraged my father so much that he burst into my room and began choking me, screaming in my face ""DON'T YOU KNOW THAT WE LOVE YOU!?"" while choking me, while my mother stood there and did nothing. This is why I am fucked up. This is how I was taught what love is by my parents. This is why I spent the last 4 years as a marijuana addict, numbing the continual feelings of pain and memory foisted upon me by having to live with my parents again for the last seven years.

I began thinking about how I need to get out of this house, how I need to move on with my life... how desperately I cannot wait for the day that when I meet new people I can just tell them that I have no family, that my parents died, and that all there is is me. I hate people who act like family is a commitment---those people do not seem to know what it is to not be loved by your parents, to only be treated as a possession, a part of a collection... my parents only wanted a son because they had two daughters, they needed to ""complete their set"" the same way they obsessed over Beanie Babies, model railroad train sets, and now Disney pins and their dachshunds... us children were always just possessions to be gawked at, but not to be loved and cared for, and the way they treat their dogs now reminds me of how they treated me... here, have some food, have some toys, now go away and stop bothering us... and when you've bothered us, when you make us feel disrespected, we will scream at you and stomp at you and scare you until you learn better. ""We love the dogs!"" they say... maybe they really think they do. Maybe they just don't know what love is.

Either way, I can't stay here anymore. I spent yesterday in bed, wishing I could dissolve into nothing, wishing I had the money to run away and never return, but alas I make only $200/mo and that's barely enough to feed myself and pay my phone bill much less pay rent on a place to live. I am too strong to commit suicide, or maybe too cowardly and weak, I don't know which much of the time (my distaste for guns largely stems from the fact that I worry if I was ever presented with a truly easy way to kill myself I would take it without thinking, with no chance for regret on the other side). So instead I just lied in bed, constantly mulling over the things I wish I could say to my parents but I know would mean nothing to them. ""How can you not know what is wrong with me when it is YOU who is wrong with me, when it is what you did!?"" Like they would even care. They don't care when I tell them to treat their dogs better. They don't even realize they are doing something wrong... ""The dogs like to squeal"" my dad says, he has so thoroughly deluded himself into thinking that the animals like to be terrified, simply because they return to him after the fact, as if the dogs have anywhere else to go...

So that was my yesterday.

I woke up miserable this morning, which is the first time in two weeks of sobriety that it has happened. Usually sleep seems to scare the demons out of my head and wake up feeling refreshed and optimistic yet again, but not this morning. I felt like I would never get out of bed. But a friend started to talk to me online, and I finished reading the ""Power of Habit"" book, which discussed an unfortunate guy from the 1800's who sounded like me: worried he wasn't good at anything, feeling like he'd never measure up to his own standards, and wondering if the only option for him was suicide. But he decided that before killing himself he'd conduct an experiment. He'd spend a year believing that he is a confident, willful person, capable doing everything he previously thought he couldn't do. He decided, just on a whim, that instead of feeling like a failure he'd try to feel like a success. It worked... he got married, he got a good job, he began doing things for himself that he'd always wanted to do. After two years, he was everything he wanted to be.

So I decided to get up and stop feeling like a loser. I got out of bed, made myself a nice breakfast, showered, slid myself into a pair of slacks, my dress shoes, and my best red polo. I made a list of all the temp/staffing agencies in the area and printed out several copies of my resume, and I just started driving around going down the list. I have an interview tomorrow after my other job at one of them. I have two more on hand that want to interview me, that I will get to tomorrow.

When I went into one place the guy behind the counter called me ""boss man"" and acted honestly surprised when I told him I was *looking* for work. Apparently he assumed based on my dress and appearance that I was actually an employer looking for employees. That really bolstered my confidence, I must say, it felt nice. Everyone else I met returned my smiles and seemed friendly, they seemed to take me seriously. I understand how I went wrong months ago when I was looking for work and failed: I just didn't believe in myself. I didn't dress as well as I could have. I didn't carry myself appropriately, nor did I speak with confidence about my abilities. A lot of this had to do with marijuana, which left me in a perpetually negative, lazy state, even when I didn't smoke. It made me stutter when I knew exactly what I wanted to say. It made my eyes look tired, even when I was wide awake. It made *me* feel tired, even if I wasn't.

The emotional rollercoaster I have been on hasn't been fun. Yesterday was so much the opposite of fun that it almost killed me. But today has been alright. Maybe tomorrow will be, too. I need to stop letting minor things get me down. I need to stop letting my past get in the way of my future. Next time I feel like lying in bed and crying my eyes out over how hopeless everything seems, I should just pick up my ukulele and play and practice and learn... I should dress myself up in my sharp business-casual attire and go out and see how different people look at me. I should smile at people and say hi to them and feel how nice it is to be taken seriously. I should remind myself that the life I've lived is not the life that I will always live, and that the future rests nowhere but within my own belief of myself.

I recorded a rough version of me playing ""Creep"" by Radiohead on my ukulele two days ago and sent it to two of my friends. The first time I've managed to learn and play a whole song... it felt good. They told me I sounded good, and I believed them, because I did sound good. I spent two years stoned trying to play guitar and never managed to learn a song or feel like I could sing one, but after a week of sober ukulele playing I feel like I am finally making progress, finally achieving something I've always wanted. I look forward to the moment that I can play a song for someone, to someone...

768,High_Commander,3 days clean after 5 years of heavy toking. Some thoughts.,"As title says these past 3 days have been the first time in 5 years that I have not been stoned. I had a habit of smoking about every two hours starting shortly after waking like clockwork. I have chosen to abstain for as long as I can hold out as a test of personal will I suppose.

the past 72 hours has been the most surreal experience I've had in years, comparable to psychedelics in many ways. For starters, the first two nights I basically did not sleep, both nights I spent wide eyed and restless in bed until the sun rose. At around this time I managed to fall asleep for about two hours each day. During both of those short naps I experienced frighteningly vivid dreams. I can't begin to explain why but these dreams have disturbed me deeply, to the point where I am actually almost afraid of sleeping now. Time spent awake feels more dream-like. Basically, my dreams feel more real than real life.

Also, my depression which before was manageable has blown into a full on existential crisis. Suicide has been a constant thought on my mind (don't worry I'm not indulgent towards these thoughts) and this feeling of existential despair has gripped me more tightly than ever before. I can't help but say to myself ""is this it? is this all that life is?""

Intense feelings of misanthropy, where I just feel disappointed with everyone around me are now constant rather than occasional. This was a problem I had before I started smoking and I'm sad to see that it hasn't changed.

I thought if I stopped smoking my head would clear and I could be more productive, and maybe its too soon to say it won't happen but I can't say that it has (to be fair I was already fairly productive as a stoner to begin with)

Basically the more I get acquainted with sober-me the more I hate it. I am still going to ride it out as long as I can (at least till 4/20) but I have felt almost no joy whatsoever these past 3 days.

I guess what I'm finding for myself is, do I need weed? no. Is my life better with it? I'm beginning to think so. I have many issues that weed seems to mitigate pretty well, but I'm uncomfortable accepting this.

**EDIT**

well its been, uh... 5 or 6 days now? and I'm still holding strong. Weed is still constantly around me, my roommates still smoke daily and I actually made a batch of weed brownies for my family last night (I didn't even lick the spoon though!) and I'm proud of myself for managing to resist it despite it being right in my face. I definitely feel much better physically than I did the first few days, I'm starting to feel ""normal"" I guess. I still feel very depressed, but I think I have legitimate reasons for feeling that way which weed was only masking. Hopefully with this sobriety I can start to address them. 4/20 is coming up and I'm very much debating whether I will partake in it or not. I'd like to think I can re-introduce weed into my life eventually as an occasional for fun thing rather than an everyday I need it thing. I think this break has not been long enough for me to make that decision though, so I will continue to abstain until I feel comfortable and confident enough that I can go back without falling back into the old habits.",1334300655,s7m9w,8,7,leaves,6,4,2012,"as title says these past 3 days have been the first time in 5 years that i have not been stoned. i had a habit of smoking about every two hours starting shortly after waking like clockwork. i have chosen to abstain for as long as i can hold out as a test of personal will i suppose.

972,itsfrank,"From weed to hard drugs to alot of weed , very hard w/d symptons..","Hey. 
20 yo atm, starting smoking weed/drinking at around 12. At 16 it turned to powders (6 month amf addict. and 4 months keta) and other party pills. Then at 18-start 20 it were mainly ""Chillax"" pills of all kinds. 
Both at ""party"" and ""chill"" mode i smoked alot of weed. 

Stopped doing ""harder"" drugs 5 months ago. Throughout the hole period of 7 years i have been smoking a shit load of bong. 5 months ago my addict gf and me broke up and moved apart (we mainly did morphine like pills of different kinds), which resultet in me choosing to only smoke weed, since she went more and more crazy and couldent control her. 

I smoke bong from the moment i wake up and cant sleep unless i smoke heavily, and i wake up at nights needing to take 3 hits and then go back to sleep. Often several times at night. 

I used weed to get through other addictions and now i mentally completely break down without it. It can in no way compare to any other drug i went off, since this have been constant early morging thing for at least 5 years and used for covering up the other drugs.

How should i stop? 
I get EXTREME mental breakdowns, my body is pretty common. Sweety and all the usual shit. 

Currently dident smoke for 48 hours = dident sleep for 48 hours.

(What i mean by mental breakdown is VERY hard depression, suicidal, and anxiety keeping me from sleeping or doing anything logically without beathing someone up hard.

i have no idea of how to get through this and im so depressed i cant believe it. Help .:(

(Tapping down dosent work, my body requires the full dose thoughtout the day or i get so much anxiety i cant control it and need to complete my ""full daily dose"". Tapping down does NOT WORK IN ANY WAY FOR ME, it is rapping me further mentally.

*EDIT: My other main problem is even if i quit for like 2-3 months then i relapse... 

*EDIT: Depression part is hitting me so hard.

1011,hypednb,"1 week in, quitting everything cold turkey","Alright guys so I've stumbled upon this awesome place about 2 weeks ago. I first started smoking about 2 years ago but only really started buying and toking alone over the past year after getting caught up with it from my rebound ex that helped me after I got out of a 4 year relationship. Since breaking up with the rebound, I began to toke 3-5 times a week and started drinking more as well (tuesday, wednesday nights, skipping morning classes but never really affecting my grades negatively). 

I've also starting getting into the rave scene and in the past month have done speed 3 times. Looking back at the this year and feeling only worse after drinking and smoking through my comedowns, I've realized it's time to stop. Though grades and work have been unaffected, motivation has certainly dropped, and I feel like I am not the best I could be because of this. 

Last friday was the last time I have smoked, rolled, and drank in the same night. Since then I have been bombarded by bipolar feelings, suicidal thoughts, mania. Exercise has not been helping, and my usual nightly walks have resulting in angry outbursts at passersby. I have taken some 5 HTP for mood elevation to no avail, sleep has been fine minus the disrupted sleep schedules that have mostly been due to my excessive gaming (havent played much at all year during the past semesters so Skyrim and diablo 3 both have me in their grasp a bit). 

In the end, it seems quitting now would be much better than near the beginning of next semester, as I will have highly quantitative graduate level classes that I have to keep up with no matter the mood fluctuations (Mathematical Finance major).

With this said, would you characterize video games as an acceptable way of dealing with these crazy emotions while they are still severe (not ignoring socializing by any means) and are these symptoms normal enough for the first week? 


I really appreciate the help guys! This is a great community and am really glad i discovered it, seeing as how most of my friends are rather snobby or busy nowadays and I don't particularly want to engage in discussing this with them as I feel it would only anger me more..

",1339122607,uqwpa,4,5,leaves,6,6,2012,"alright guys so i've stumbled upon this awesome place about 2 weeks ago. i first started smoking about 2 years ago but only really started buying and toking alone over the past year after getting caught up with it from my rebound ex that helped me after i got out of a 4 year relationship. since breaking up with the rebound, i began to toke 3-5 times a week and started drinking more as well (tuesday, wednesday nights, skipping morning classes but never really affecting my grades negatively). 

i've also starting getting into the rave scene and in the past month have done speed 3 times. looking back at the this year and feeling only worse after drinking and smoking through my comedowns, i've realized it's time to stop. though grades and work have been unaffected, motivation has certainly dropped, and i feel like i am not the best i could be because of this. 

last friday was the last time i have smoked, rolled, and drank in the same night. since then i have been bombarded by bipolar feelings, suicidal thoughts, mania. exercise has not been helping, and my usual nightly walks have resulting in angry outbursts at passersby. i have taken some 5 htp for mood elevation to no avail, sleep has been fine minus the disrupted sleep schedules that have mostly been due to my excessive gaming (havent played much at all year during the past semesters so skyrim and diablo 3 both have me in their grasp a bit).

1061,sooibot,Progress report: Day 365,"Let me preface this wall of text with the following; I'm writing this mostly for myself, if you find it useful, that's an added bonus. Also, this kind of thing is usually ""required"", since well, it's something of a milestone. Oh, and I swear sometimes.

I could go into my life story here, and in detail explain everything, I won't, don't worry, not because it's boring, but because it's kind of trivial now. I learnt very quickly on my path that trying to find your similarities in a story to somehow validate the message invariably dilutes it if it doesn't fit your own, so I'll keep this part short. I'm 27 years old, well educated, well cared for. I'm a know-it-all, an underachiever, unmotivated and introverted. 

I went through school always feeling like I'm on the outside. I never belonged is pretty cliche, but that's how I felt. I made friends easily, although I never truly let them know the real me, because I somehow felt that the real me wasn't good enough. Eventually, I did make good friends, and they are my friends to this day. I was bullied, mostly verbally and emotionally, but I quickly learnt that I bruise too easily (on a psycological level). I developed a sharp tongue to defend myself, and also a viewpoint that most people are just fucked up.

I used quite late in my schooling, and didn't really get too stuck into it. I was mostly into gaming though, my first real addiction. I had withdrawels from games when I went on holiday one year, cold sweats, nightmares, irratibility. I didn't think too much of it then, I see differently now. University was a dream for me, I wanted to get away from my parents, who fought, every night, all the time. Here, I started drinking and smoking pot heavily. I partied. A. Lot. It was normal? No, I failed. I did NOTHING but have fun, no contrast to working, fun became the normal, and eventually, I stopped having fun.

Things happened. My relationships were toxic. My habit slowly grew. After my parents divorced, I was smoking everyday, all the time. This daily thing went on for about 3 years, I did eventually pass my degree, but not my Honors. I could've done my Masters, it is within my capabilities. I lost two jobs. I have a shit-ton of debt. I was filled with regret. I fantasized about suicide. I hated myself. I needed a change.

I did the whole rehab thing. I wasn't going to fuck this up as well, so I made two promises to myself; ""For us is not to question why, for us is but to do or die"", and no more lying to myself. The rehab wasn't just a 28 day stint, but a primary, followed by a 3 month secondary, then 2 months in a ""transition"" house. I went to hundreds of meetings. The meetings were great, I took every opportunity to speak up. I've done going to psychologists my whole life, but group therapy helped me more than I could ever realized. There's something about realizing that you're not as fucked up as you think, and there are others like you, that actually boosts it a lot.

I realized that drugs and booze aren't my only problems. First and foremost, I have a self-esteem problem. I struggle with anything that gives me pleasure, because I seek it without thinking, without caring for myself first. I have intimacy issues. I have father issues. I have group issues. I seek out being bored, lonely, angry and shameful because I use those emotions to justify using something, anything... It invariably leads me to being bored, lonely, angry or shamed, which is just the cycle repeating itself.

I had to learn to love myself first. To forgive myself. To let go of my regrets, let go of my delusions, and rediscover myself. I had to change my entire mindset. Some quickly pounce on 12-stepping as brainwashing, but who the fuck cares if it is? My brain was fucked up enough. My best thinking got my to the lowest point in my life, and I was incapable of getting myself out of it in the mindset I was in. I had to look at life differently, at people differently, at myself differently.

Slowly, things changed. I went through the usual stages of loss, and then, the honeymoon phase where I was on a pink cloud. After that, I hit the wall. Is this is? Is this bland, normal, responsible way of life, life? I became depressed easily. Things would come up, my relationships, my parents, my friends, my siblings. I cried. A. Lot. One day I recounted the story of myself carrying the still warm carcass of my dog, run over in front of me in the street, when I was 6. It's one of my earliest memories. I fucking bawled my eyes out for 3 hours straight. It was on of the best experiences of my life.

For most of the people reading this, what I did was intensive. It was everyday, wake up, therapy, lunch, therapy, supper, meeting, therapy. It's not for everyone. When I was done, I could easily become a counsellor. I didn't, fuck that. I had to get back into society. I had to see my friends (who all still party). I had to move on with my life. So I did. I'm not nearly independent yet, but I have made progress in that. I got a job, something that I work hard at.

I started going out. I love dancing, so I did that too. Now, if someone says being in a club sober is hard, try dancing... Weird as shit. But I did it, and had fun. I started to have more and more fun. Now, I can go out with friends, and when the ""party gets heavy"", I remove myself. No point staying up past 1am popping pills or smoking bongs. I can have fun without using, this, was a huge revelation. 

I got involved with a girl. Big fucking mistake. Since, well, she had a boyfriend at the time, and she was crazy as batshit (I seem to attract those... another story entirely, but big part of my White Knight issues). She fucked with my head completely, and very nearly broke me down. When they said no relationships in the first year, I scoffed, now I know. She did reveal to me that it's possible for me to chat girls up when I'm sober, and also... ahem.. carrying on.

I started to love myself. To build up my self-esteem. Previously mentioned girl even said that I'm so cool, I have my shit together. No-one has ever said that to me before. For the first time in my life, I'm doing stuff for myself. If I have a problem with someone or something, I talk about it, I don't let it fester. A lot of this might just be termed as ""growing up"", but for me, it's a motherfucking huge deal. Does it get easier? Hell yeah it does. Do you think about smoking less? Well, it's only been a year, and 4 years ago I broke up from my first love, and I still think about her, so I think I'll be thinking about Mary Jane for a while still.

Did I love weed? Yeah I did, and I still do, all I know now is that I can't love myself and justify smoking. For me to justify it, I need to find everything wrong in the world, think about everything sad, lame people, fucked up shit... and use it to bring myself down. I'm so insignificant. I'm so useless. I'm so depressed. Let's just smoke!

I don't do that anymore. Why? Because it's a fucking waste of time. Time is the most precious thing to me on this earth, and I'm done wasting it. I don't let stupid shit bother me, because why care about something I have no control over? I live my life now, the way it should be lived.",1340122321,va4qm,7,43,leaves,3,6,2012,"let me preface this wall of text with the following; i'm writing this mostly for myself, if you find it useful, that's an added bonus. also, this kind of thing is usually ""required"", since well, it's something of a milestone. oh, and i swear sometimes.

1144,floleopard,"It's been an interesting 4 years Mary Jane, but today I say goodbye. ","I'm new to Reddit...but here's a little background about myself. I am a junior girl in college majoring in psychology with a minor in journalism. I make fairly good grades and have managed to keep (so far) my full-tuition scholarship. I started smoking pot when I was a junior in high school. All of my friends had started doing it, and eventually I felt that I should too. At first it was great: I met a ton of new people, had more fun than ever before, and I felt that it helped me with (or at least distracted me from) my chronic depression. I smoked even more after I was hospitalized for a suicide attempt during the summer. Throughout my senior year of high school, my life began/continued to fall apart. I didn't care about anything...I was so depressed and suicidal that my life meant nothing to me and I was destroying almost every part of it piece by piece. I smoked more and more weed, and experimented with other drugs to make the pain disappear. A few months later, me and two of my friends were caught smoking bud in a parking lot by our local police. It was one of the most humiliating experiences of my life, and after my  day in court, I was given fines, drug classes, random drug tests, and NA or AA meetings. My drivers license was also suspended for 1 year for being in the back seat of a parked car with pot in it....

But I jumped through all their hoops, and by college I was a happy toker again. I made friends, found one shitty boyfriend, and then a new amazing one. I got the cutest cat in the world, and I was so happy to be independent. Recently I went to Hangout Music Festival with my amazing boyfriend and had the best time of my life trippin, smoking, and dancing in the sand....

SO WHAT HAPPENED?

Well, I guess it started with my friend giving me a FREE Bonnaroo ticket (condition: I had to drive). I said HELL YEAH and we packed up and went. We had a great time, and we left Sunday night so I could get back by my class on Monday. Unfortunately, I did not make it to class. While I was driving back, I was swerving some. This WAS NOT because I was on any substances. We had smoked some bud hours before when we were leaving, but I wasn't still high (but was possibly coming down). All I was really on though was LACK OF SLEEP....and no, you can't smoke that. They pulled us over right after I had found and lit a cigarette. My friend was asleep, and I knew immediately that we were screwed. Long story short...they searched the car, and we spent the night in jail. I cried the whole time I was there. It was the worst night of my life. I knew I couldn't call my parents. They would not support me in this, my second fuck-up. Luckily my wonderful boyfriend was able to bail me out, and we were able to see my friend through court that afternoon. We were both charged with were possession of marijuana and paraphernalia. I was also charged with a DUI, which I hope to have dropped. 

Court is in a month, and I have decided to get clean not just in preparation for drug tests, but also to protect my future. I am a 20 year old, blonde, white girl. I like to do yoga and read; I don't even really like to drink, but since I smoke weed I'm considered a criminal and have been in jail not once, but twice. Although I'm sure I'll have a celebratory smoke when I finish all of this legal shit, I plan to quit at least until I am in a state where possession is decriminalized, and/or I can get a medical card. I have mixed feelings about stopping. I know it will be insanely hard. I've tried ""t-breaks"" more times than I can count without much success, but I believe that this time is different. I recognize that I do have an addiction, and I am determined to stop smoking....I still love weed, it's just time for us to part ways for a while. But anyways, I guess we'll see how this goes.....wish me luck :) -Day 1.",1341521188,w3eia,3,11,leaves,5,7,2012,"i'm new to reddit...but here's a little background about myself. i am a junior girl in college majoring in psychology with a minor in journalism. i make fairly good grades and have managed to keep (so far) my full-tuition scholarship. i started smoking pot when i was a junior in high school. all of my friends had started doing it, and eventually i felt that i should too. at first it was great: i met a ton of new people, had more fun than ever before, and i felt that it helped me with (or at least distracted me from) my chronic depression. i smoked even more after i was hospitalized for a suicide attempt during the summer. throughout my senior year of high school, my life began/continued to fall apart. i didn't care about anything...i was so depressed and suicidal that my life meant nothing to me and i was destroying almost every part of it piece by piece. i smoked more and more weed, and experimented with other drugs to make the pain disappear. a few months later, me and two of my friends were caught smoking bud in a parking lot by our local police. it was one of the most humiliating experiences of my life, and after my  day in court, i was given fines, drug classes, random drug tests, and na or aa meetings. my drivers license was also suspended for 1 year for being in the back seat of a parked car with pot in it....
